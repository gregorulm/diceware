Description
===========
This is a throwaway script I wrote to generate Diceware phrases.
Diceware is described here:
http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html


Execution
=========
Assuming you have Python installed on your computer, execute this script
by calling "python diceware.py".

The name of the word list as well as the number of parts of the
passphrase are hardcoded, and can be easily changed.
